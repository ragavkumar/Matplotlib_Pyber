### Pyber Data Analysis

Overview:
* Urban areas use Pyber the most, followed by suburban areas, while rural areas use it the least
* However, in terms of average fares, the order is reversed
* This contrast may be attributed to the number of Pyber drivers in each city type i.e. since urban areas have more drivers, the fares could have been competitively priced

Analysis by city type:
* Total Fares by City Type: Urban areas generate the most revenue (~2/3rds) for Pyber in fares, followed by suburban and rural areas
* Total Rides by City Type: In terms of number of rides, urban dwellers request the most rides (~2/3rds) from Pyber, followed by suburban and rural areas
* Total Drivers by City Type: Majority of Pyber drivers operate in urban areas, whereas the number of drivers in rural areas constitute a very small percentage

Limitations:
* Distance of each ride - This can help understand the correlation between ride distance and fare. Probably, the reason why rural customers are charged higher fares is because they travel longer distances; thus, it may not be solely attributed to the low driver count
* Data of rival ride-sharing companies operating in the same areas - Are fares lower in urban areas because Pyber had to slash rates due to heavy competition from rival companies? Are fares higher in rural areas because no such competition exists there?
* Population of cities - The low driver count in rural areas may be attributed to lesser demand, which is expected if they have a lower population density. This is pretty much a given, but it would be nice to validate this point with data
